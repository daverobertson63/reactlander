# Reactlander
A implementation of the classic Lunar Lander game using React and Canvas in ES6

This was built originally with the react transform boilerplate from
https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate

This game is a combination of two games

http://www.somethinghitme.com/projects/jslander/

and

https://github.com/chriz001/Reacteroids

As part of learning React - I combined both to form a Lunar Lander in React.

Copyright is given in Reactlander.js for both sources.

Everything in the original jslander game has been converted to use ES6 with Babel transpiler
